# GearedCameraInC
EPITA S4 project :

A group made of Maxence Crouzy, Yassine Damiri, Thuraya Shanbari and Karim Abou-Dargham.
We created a mechanical support that can hold a camera which will follow the person being filmed on two axes with the help of the two support platforms. This implies that the person being filmed will be detected and centered after an image treatment. This information will be then sent to the computer which will then deduce the movement of the camera on its axes.
We hope our project will be a source of interest for you and we are excited to go on this journey together as a group.
